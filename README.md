# SICP

## Environment setup

```
brew install mit-scheme
```

If you are having problems with scheme interpreter history (e.g., arrow up doesn't show a previous command), install `rlwrap`:

```
brew install rlwrap
```

Run scheme interpreter like so:

```
rlwrap mit-scheme
```

Create an alias for convenience:

```
alias scm='rlwrap mit-scheme'
```
